# ZindaCSS
ZindaCSS is an open source CSS framework that generates CSS classes for your HTML documents. This eliminates the need for writing CSS, and reduces the effort needed to design websites.
It generates classes based on your requirements, which means you do not have to include hundreds of unused classes in your stylesheets.
It contains over **thousand** predefined classes, giving you control over various aspects of website design, including colors, backgrounds, borders, responsiveness. It also includes many animations.
If one of the thousand classes do not satisify your needs, then you can also generate custom classes. Eg. "color_#00ff00" gives the text a green color.
You can add classes like ":hover" and ":focus" to add pseudoselectors to CSS. Example "color-blue:hover" gives a blue color only when hovered.
Your file is monitored for changes as soon as you save your file, and a new stylesheet is generated immediately
You can group classes together. If many elements have the same style, you can simply use <zindagroups> for adding styles accross many elements.

It also contains a documentation: https://anirudh-munipalli.github.io/zindacss-documentation/
